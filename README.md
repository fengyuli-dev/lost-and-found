## Summary
To be finished.
## The Database
This project contains a SQL database with three tables: user, lost, and found. Table "user" has one-to-many relationships with "lost" and "found".
## API Documentation
A HTTP status code of 500 indicates internal server error and should be reported to the backend developer.  
For post methods, the field time should be in the format: TBD.
