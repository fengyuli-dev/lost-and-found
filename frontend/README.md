Greetings from the frontend members!

The file "Lost and Found 3.zip" demonstrates that the code is NOT CHANGED after 12:00 pm by the due date.
HOWEVER:
We are new members to GitHub and there are many problems with this file. Right now the app can NOT be successfully run. This is because we don't know how to upload an entire swift project onto GitHub.
HOWEVER, we have found a way to run it based on the current files. If you want to run it (highly recommended!), keep reading:
1. Download all the files.
2. ONLY unzip the "Lost and Found.xcodeproj.zip" and open it. You will probably see that something is missing.
3. Back to the "frontend" directory, install the "Alamofire" and "SnapKit" pods.
4. delete the missing "trash_full" image file. Back in the "Image" folder, there is an image file with the same name ("trash_full"). Simply drag it to the same place you delete the original one. Follow the instructions and load in the file.
5. Do NOT delete the missing "Asset". Back in the folder "Lost and Found", there is also a "Asset", and it is a folder. Simply drag it to the place where the original "Asset" is.
6. MOREOVER, there is an image file in "Image" folder called "logo1". Also drag that into the current valid "Asset".
7. Now run the app and you should see it run perfectly.
8. Thank you for coming this far!! We are more than grateful for you to allow our awkward uploading and still want to see the app. If there is still any questions, just come ask me (PORRIDGE_ZOU). Or you can watch the video to catch a glimpse of the app.

Thank you!
