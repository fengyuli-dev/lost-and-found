Hello!

If you download the file but it fails to run, it is because that the images are not loaded successfully (we failed to fix that). I recommend two ways:
1. We have stored all the images in the file "Image", with the same name in the code. Unzip the "lost and found 3.zip" and use it instead by removing all the images on error and load in all the new ones.
2. Simply delete all the files on error, and run it without seeing these images (it may reduce much experience).

Thank you!
