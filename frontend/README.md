# lost_and_found
Greetings from the frontend! Please follow the instructions to build the project properly:
1. Download zip and unzip it;
2. Open the Lost and Found.xcworkspace file;
3. Inside the file opened, delete the "Assets" file inside, which is probably reddished;
4. Drag the Assets.xcassets folder from the original file into the workspace. This would create a new Assets but not reddish.
5. Now build the project. It would work. If further questions pop up, please contact me: porridgeorge@gmail.com
